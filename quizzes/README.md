Additional information on Quizzes is provided in [this section of the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#quizzes) and we will also provide guidance regarding getting help and completing the Quiz forms as part of the Quiz instructions.

## Getting Help during a Quiz

All quizzes in 431 are open book, open notes. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website and that we've been reading in the class, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants. You will be required to complete a short affirmation that you have obeyed these rules as part of submitting the Quiz.

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you will have exactly two ways of getting help:

1. You can ask your question in a private post on Piazza to the instructors. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
2. You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**. This email is only open to you during the period after a Quiz has been released and before it is due.

For each Quiz, we will not answer questions about the Quiz except through the two approaches listed above. 

A few cautions:

- Specific questions are more likely to get helpful answers.
- We will not review your code or your English for you.
- We will not tell you if your answer is correct, or if it is complete.
- We will email all students if we find an error in the Quiz that needs fixing.

### When Should I ask for help?

We recommend the following process.

- If you encounter a tough question, skip it, and build up your confidence by tackling other questions.
- When you return to the tough question, spend no more than 10-15 minutes on it.
If you still don't have it, take a break (not just to do other questions) but an actual break.
- When you return to the question, it may be much clearer to you. If so, great. If not, spend 5-10 minutes on it, at most, and if you are still stuck, ask us for help.
- This is not to say that you cannot ask us sooner than this, but you should **never, ever** spend more than 20 minutes on any question without asking for help.
